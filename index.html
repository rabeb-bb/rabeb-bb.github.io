     <h2>Seriously, what the heck else do you want?</h2>
     <!-- maybe a less agressive tone.-->
      <p>You probably build websites and think your crap is special.
        You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you
        some freaking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site.
        You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a high
         because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfreaker.
         Let me describe your perfect-butt website:</p>
         <p>
            <ul>
              <li>thing's lightweight and loads fast</li>
              <li>Fits on all your crappy screens</li>
              <li>Looks the same in all your crappy browsers</li>
              <li>The motherfreaker's accessible to every butthead that visits your site</li>
              <li>Shit's legible and gets your frigging point across
                (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
      <h3>Well guess what, motherfreaker:</h3>
         <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this crap.
            It's a MotherLoving website.
            Why the heck do you need to animate a frigging trendy-butt banner flag
            when I hover over that useless piece of crap?
            You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fricking site,
            and some motherfreaker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers
            will never see that shit.
            Not to mention blind people will never see that shit,
           but they don't see any of your crappy trash.<br/>
           You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.
         </p>
      <h2>It's freaking lightweight</h2>
         <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo
           on your frigging Wordpress site.
           Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate
           the freaking background color of a div?
           You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a crappy webfont just so you could say "Hi."
           at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of poop.</p>

           </figure>


      <h2>It's responsive</h2>

         <p>You butthead. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no.
           Responsive means that it responds to whatever freaken screensize it's
           viewed on.
           This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a stinking Tamagotchi.</p>
           <figure>
             <img src="no_intelligent.gif" alt="no sign of intelligent life here"/>
           </figure>



      <h2>It freaking works</h2>

         <p>Look at this crap. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, dumb-butt.
           It makes sense. It has motherfreaking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags
           so you and your female dog-butt browser know what the heck's in this freaking site.
           That's semantics, idiot.<br/>
           It has content on the damn screen. Your site has three bylines and link
           to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me
           click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.<br/>
           Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfreaker in IE6. I freaking dare you.</p>

        <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>

           <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true
             natural state is, you have no frigging idea what a website is.
              All you have ever seen are crappy skeuomorphic bastardizations<!--It is getting hard to clean up the language--> of what
              should be text communicating a freakin' message.
             This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's so beautiful.</P>

         <h3>Yes, this is freaking satire, you idiot</h3>
         <figure>
           <img src="stupid_Ramsey.gif" alt="are you stupid"/>

           <p>I'm not actually saying your crappy site should look like this.
              What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones
               we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional,
              high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-gun.</p>
